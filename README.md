## Game Overview

In this game, your objective is to take steps forward by clicking two buttons in alternating order. While the character on the screen has their back turned, you can click to move forward. However, if you click when the character faces forward, your score will reset to zero. The game tracks your best scores and saves them in the browserâ€™s local storage.

- **Step Counter**: Your score increases as you successfully alternate clicks between the right and left buttons.
- **Penalty for Mistakes**:
  - If you click the same button twice in a row, you lose a point.
  - If you click while the character faces forward, your score resets to zero.
- **Persistent Score**: High scores are stored locally in the browser, and a leaderboard on the home screen shows the top scores.
